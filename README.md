# Calendar App

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for setting and keeping track of appointments

## Primary Objective

Use a Software Engineering approach to determine the requirements and constraints of this project.

## Primary Goal

Create a Progressive Web App (PWA) that is fully functional and production ready.

        * No unverifiable email addresses
        * No sharing of subscription with other users (one acccount, one subscriber)

## Implementation

      * Design and build as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
      * Use PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for codebase
      * RDBMS - MariaDB 
      * Hosting - Bluehost, with cPanel (for now)
      * Utilize packages, modules, and libraries for faster development
